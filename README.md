The film begins with an IPO, and then the historical stage is set by showing the beginnings of software development back to the time when software was shared on paper tape for the price of the paper itself. It then moves to Bill Gates’ Open Letter to Hobbyists in which he asked Computer Hobbyists to not share, but to buy software. Witch started a movement where they didn’t want to buy proprietary software they wanted free software for everyone had the source code 
This movie was about the founding of GNU and Linux open software and the men that made it happen.
It is impressive to know about their great desire to make internet and software accessible to everyone without being charged with huge amount of money. When Richard Stallman said, “If I will develop an operating system I will make it free for everyone” it very rare to have a business not money hungry and just make a nice product and make it free here are some descriptions of the men who made up this money and their long long journey from just 1 end user to millions and millions of end users using Linux. 

LINUS TORVALDS

RICHARD STALLMAN

Stallman founded the GNU Project in 1984 in an attempt to create his own Unix-like operating system that was freely shareable. He also started the Free Software movement to espouse his political agenda of freely-shared intellectual property. Stallman's philosophical and technical work became the foundation for Linux and the Open Source movement.

MICHAEL TIEMANN
>In 1989 Tiemann co-founded the first company based upon the GNU Project technology and principles of the Free Software movement. Tiemann is currently the CTO of Redhat Software, the most prominent Linux company.

LARRY AUGUSTIN
>Augustin co-founded VA Linux Systems, one of the first companies based upon the Linux operating system. VA Linux Systems was a key early supporter of Linux and the Open Source movement. VA Linux System also set the record for the highest opening price for and IPO. On December 9, 1999, its first trade was at $299 per share. Currently, the stock trades around $5 per share.
